# jrachele.com
This repository contains the source files for my Flask-based personal website running at http://www.jrachele.com/
The site serves mainly as a portfolio, although I do run an interactive data visualization app on http://www.jrachele.com/research

Given the simplistic nature of the site, the site runs from a simple app.py, and Flask-Babel is used to allow for locales.
The site is available in English and French.
